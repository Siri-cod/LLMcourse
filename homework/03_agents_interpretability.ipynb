        "\n",
        "An increasingly popular approach to language generation is so called *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG) wherein a language model is supplied with additional (textual) information retrieved from some storage, in addition to the actual task query. It has been found that this additional context improves model performance, and, e.g., allows to use LLMs with custom information (e.g., proprietary documents etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "The general set up of a RAG system is as follows:\n",
        "1. Some form of a database (DB) with (searchable) relevant background information (e.g., a database, a set of documents, ...) is created.\n",
        "   1. A common database format are *vector DBs*, or, vectore stores. You can optionally learn more about vector DBs, e.g., here: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/. The important conceptual point is that some form of a searchable database with relevant (textual) information is created.\n",
        "2. An LLM that will be generating the responses to the queries, given context, is chosen.\n",
        "3. An embedding model is chosen.\n",
        "4. Task queries (e.g., questions or instructions) are provided to the system.\n",
        "   1. The query is converted to an embedding (using the model chosen ins tep 3), and the embedding is used to search and retrieve relevant information from the database. The specific retrieval method depnds on the nature of the database.\n",
        "   2. The relevant information is supplied to the LLM as context.\n",
        "5. Given the extended context, the LLM provides output.\n",

        "**YOUR TASK**\n",
        "> Your task in this exercise is to explore RAG by implementing a RAG system for recipe generation. The implemented RAG system should be compared to the performance of the same model in a \"vanilla\" set-up where the model solves the task directly.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> We will use the package `LlamaIndex` and the LLM `microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct` model as the backbone for the implementation. We will use the `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model as our embedding model.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> We will use unstructured data in the form of a recipe dataset `m3hrdadfi/recipe_nlg_lite`. This dataset will be indexed and it will be used to supplement information for the LLM, additionally to the query. The train split of the dataset should be used for the index, and a sample from the test dataset will be used for sampling queries with which the system will be tested.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> For this task, please complete the following steps:\n",
        "> 1. Download the dataset from Huggingface.\n",
        "> 2. Briefly familiarize yourself with the dataset.\n",
        "> 3. Briefly familiarize yourself with [this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example_local/) LLamaIndex example RAG system.  \n",
        "> 4. Complete the code below (in place of \"### YOUR CODE HERE ####\"), following the instructions in the comments to build a working RAG system that will generate recipes. Note that you will have to work with the LlamaIndex documentation to complete and understand the code. Some links are already provided.\n",

salt and pepper, 1 tsp fresh thyme, 2 tsp fresh chopped basil\\n\\nit's important to have your vegetables chopped, sliced and fully prepared before you begin . there are a few different ways to roast the peppers click here for options . with this dish i usually throw them directly on the burner of my gas stove and let them cook until the skin chars and blisters . with tongs, carefully turn the peppers so that they roast evenly on all sides . the peppers are done roasting when they are soft and starting to collapse . transfer the roasted peppers to a large mixing bowl . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the peppers to steam for 15 minutes . you can also steam them in a paper bag if you prefer . while the peppers are steaming, prepare and chop the rest of your ingredients . the roma tomatoes, zucchini, japanese eggplant and yellow squash should be sliced very thin, about 1/16 in thickness . this is best done with a sharp serrated knife or a mandoline . it does take a bit of time, but the result is totally worth it . once your peppers have finished steaming, peel off the skin and remove the seeds and ribs under cool running water . roughly chop the peeled peppers and set aside . in a food processor, combine the chopped vine ripened tomatoes, chopped peppers, basil, 2 tsp crushed garlic, salt, smoked paprika, cayenne, paprika and oregano and pulse until you have a rough puree with texture . taste the mixture add additional spices and salt to taste, if desired . note that the flavors will develop more during cooking don't overdo the spice, you'll taste it more when the dish is completely cooked . heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a sauteuse pan or heavy bottomed skillet over medium high until hot . spread out the sliced mushrooms in a single layer in the pan . let them stand without stirring for 2 minutes until they are golden brown on the bottom . begin stirring the mushrooms continue stirring for another 2 3 minutes till they are nicely browned throughout . remove mushrooms from the skillet and set aside . add the remaining 2 tbsp of the olive oil to the pan and saute the minced onions, carrots and celery, scraping up any brown bits as you stir . cook until the largest pieces of carrot and celery are soft and the onions are caramelized . add the mushrooms back to the pan along with the tomato mixture and stir to combine . bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat . preheat oven to 300 degrees f . start to layer on the sliced vegetables by first overlapping them in a circle around the outer edge . layer them close to each other don't worry, you should have plenty of veggies to cover the whole surface . continue the same pattern until all of the sliced vegetables have been used . if you have extra vegetables you may want to double the layer in the center circle . in a small bowl, combine 2 tbsp of olive oil with 1 tsp crushed garlic, salt and pepper . mix well and drizzle over the top of the sliced vegetables . sprinkle the top lightly with salt and pepper, then sprinkle the fresh thyme over the top of the dish . cover the pan with a lid or a layer of parchment paper . bake for 90 minutes . remove the the lid or parchment and increase the heat to 350 degrees f . cook for an additional 45 minutes . garnish with fresh basil . serve hot over cauliflower couscous, mashed potatoes or your favorite starch . this dish takes a long time to prep, but the good news is you can prepare pretty much the whole thing up to 2 days in advance . slice the vegetables a mandolin will speed up this process and place them into plastic zipper bags . roast the peppers and make the tomato pepper sauce, then place in a sealed tupperware . mix the olive oil and garlic mixture and chop any herbs for garnish . refrigerate all of the ingredients . that way, all you'll need to do is assemble and cook on the day you serve . you may want to extend the baking time at 300 degrees by 10 15 minutes if the sauce is cold when it goes into the oven . i don't recommend freezing this dish, as the vegetables will become very mushy when reheated.\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None,
